# Easypad
A macropad which has switchable modes! It will contain various shortcuts to make using a computer easier (such as ctrl+c, ctrl+v, etc.). It uses a 4x4 button matrix, Neopixel LEDs, and a 0.91" 128x32 SSD1306 Monochrome OLED Display

# My Experiance:
While making my macropad, I really learned a lot about using Fusion to make 3D models and also using KiCad to make my first PCB! I had a lot of fun and really enjoyed the experience of doing what I have always wanted to do. Thank you Hack Club for giving me the helpful tutorials and resources to make my first macropad!
